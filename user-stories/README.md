# User Stories Documentation

This directory contains the user stories for the **ALX Airbnb Clone Project**, translated from the use case diagram.

## Contents
- **`user-stories.md`**: Lists the core user interactions as structured stories.  
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview of this task.  

## Task Objective
Convert the use case diagram into actionable user stories to guide development.  

## How to Use
1. Refer to `user-stories.md` for the detailed stories.  
2. Developers should implement features based on these stories.  
3. Testers can derive test cases from the acceptance criteria (implied in stories).  

## Notes
- Error handling (e.g., "Display Error" in the diagram) is included as extension points.  
- Future iterations may refine or expand these stories.
